When building, always use `v .` (make sure you are in the project root before running)

You can do a production build with `v -prod .`

Be sparse when adding comments in the code. Do not add unnecessary comments. Do add comments when explaining larger, more complicated code paths. Especially in things like the parser and compiler or vm.
