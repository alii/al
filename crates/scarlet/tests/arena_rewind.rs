//! The two boundaries where an index can outlive the arena that minted it.
//!
//! 1. `IncrementalSession` rewinds. `Compiler::reset_to` truncates the
//!    inference arena, the code/function/constant pools and the lowered Core
//!    IR back to a `Watermark`. Anything surviving that still holds an index
//!    into one of them must be truncated, filtered, or cleared.
//!
//! 2. The precompiled stdlib blob. `seed_static` memcpys the `.rodata` arenas
//!    in as the live engine's prefix, and every `Ty` frozen into a static
//!    `Scheme` indexes there, so no rewind may cross it.
