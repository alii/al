//! `scarlet lint` — the CLI half of the `.scrl` illegal-state census.
//!
//! The census used to be `cargo xtask scrl-census` and is now
//! `scarlet_core::lint`, so every assertion here drives the real binary rather
//! than calling the library: a census reachable only from `scarlet_core` would
//! leave the unit tests green while `scarlet lint` did nothing at all, which is
//! the one failure the move can introduce.
//!
//! What these do not witness is the census logic — which shapes it reports and
//! which it declines to — that is unit-tested beside it in `scarlet_core::lint`.
