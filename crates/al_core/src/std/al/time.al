/**
 * Monotonic time.
 *
 * monotonic() returns an Instant representing "now" on a clock that only ever
 * moves forward - it is unaffected by wall-clock adjustments (NTP steps, leap
 * seconds, the user changing the system time) - so it is the right primitive
 * for measuring durations, computing deadlines, and timing out I/O.
 *
 * Instant is opaque: it can only be obtained from monotonic() (or its deadline
 * form, deadline_in_ms) and only moved with add_ms / compared with since_ms, so
 * a wall-clock ms count or a bare duration cannot be passed where an absolute
 * monotonic deadline is expected.
