//! `wire`'s descriptor builder: a resolved type in, the descriptor that
//! `wire.encode`/`wire.decode` walk out, or a refusal naming the sub-type that
//! cannot cross and the path down to it.
//!
//! The descriptor is a **finite table** describing a value that is not: a
//! `List(Int)` is unbounded, but its descriptor is two nodes, and `Cons.tail`
//! is an index back at the node it sits in. That closure is bought by memoising
//! a nominal node under [`Key::Nominal`] *before* its fields are walked, so the
//! recursive occurrence finds the node already under construction. The memo is
//! keyed on the arguments' **descriptor nodes**, never on their [`RTy`]s:
//! substitution mints a fresh `RTy` for `Cons.tail`'s `List(Int)` every time,
//! so an `RTy`-keyed memo would never hit and the walk would not terminate.
//!
//! Encoding refuses exactly what decoding refuses. The asymmetry is tempting —
//! bytes can be written for things that cannot be read back — and it is
//! precisely what must not be allowed: a program that can write what it can
//! never read has been handed a corruption it will find later, elsewhere.
//!
//! Every value is encodable. The one refusal is [`Reason::TypeVariable`], a
//! fact about inference rather than about a value. An opaque type from
//! another module is described by its constructors like any other type.
//! `Pid`, `Subject`, `Connection`, `TlsConnection` and `net.Server` are
//! described as an [`Node::Identity`], which the runtime writes as the run
//! that minted the handle, its kind and its number. A function type is a
//! [`Node::Closure`] over its parameter and return types, which the runtime
//! writes as the run that made the closure, its function index and its
//! captures — each capture carrying its own tag, because the static type
//! fixes neither how many there are nor what they hold. A type no value has —
//! a `pub type Name` with no body that is none of the five handles — is a
//! [`Node::Uninhabited`]: nothing can be written or read for it, and it is
//! met only in a position the walk never takes, a phantom argument or a field
//! of a constructor no value is, so `Tagged(Native)` over an `Int` field
//! describes and its bytes are the `Int`.
//!
//! Type identity is always [`TypeId`], never `Con.name`: a user's `type Parsed`
//! and `scarlet/http/h1.Parsed` share a name and are different types.
