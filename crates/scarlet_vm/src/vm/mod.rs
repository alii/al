//!
//! The design in five facts:
//!
//! - A context switch is a few pointer moves. The running process lives
//!   directly in the VM's `heap`/`stack`/`frames` fields, and a suspended one
//!   is those same fields packed into a [`Process`].
//! - Preemption is budgeted. A slice runs until [`REDUCTION_BUDGET`] is spent:
//!   a call costs one reduction, a syscall [`IO_REDUCTION_COST`], so an accept
//!   loop is preempted like everything else.
//! - Blocking parks the process, never the thread. An op that would block
//!   returns [`Step::Parked`] with a [`Wait`]; the wake re-runs the
//!   instruction.
//! - Work moves between schedulers as owned memory. Spawns copy the closure
//!   graph into a fresh heap; load balancing donates whole queued processes.
//!   Plain moves in both cases.
//! - Memory is reference-counted, so there is no rooting rule and no
//!   allocation reservation. A process owns every heap value it can reach,
//!   which is what makes seeds, migrants, and suspended processes `Send` by
//!   construction — and why main's result is stashed as a `(value, heap)`
//!   pair until `run()`'s caller is done with it.
