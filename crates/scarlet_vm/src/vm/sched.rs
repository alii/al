//! The multi-core scheduler runtime.
//!
//! A [`Runtime`] is built before any code runs, with only scheduler 0's poller.
//! Worker threads, one per core beyond the main thread, are summoned by the
//! first spawn ([`Runtime::ensure_workers`]).
//!
//! A spawn queues the child on the spawning scheduler; work reaches other
//! schedulers only by donation ([`Runtime::hand`] / [`Runtime::donate`]) or,
//! for `net.serve`'s per-core acceptors, as a [`Seed`] pinned to a chosen
//! scheduler: an owned mini-heap holding a deep copy of the closure graph
//! plus the root pointing into it, adopted whole. A process's heap is only
//! ever touched by the scheduler currently running it.
//!
//! Idle schedulers park inside their poller and are woken via
//! [`mio::Waker::wake`].
